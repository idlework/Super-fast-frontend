#Super fast frontend

## ECMAScript 6 (ECMAScript 2015)
At Kaliber we write code that is future proof. This is why we already implement features that are implemented in ECMAScript 6. We use [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to support the ECMAScript 6 features.

### General reads and documentations

Leanpub has a nice write up about [understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/).
Babel has [a detailed overview of ECMAScript 6 features](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).
Traceur made by Google got a great list of [language features](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures).
[es6-features.org](https://es6-features.org) has wonderful examples of comparison between ECMAScript 5 and ECMAScript  6.

### In depth documentation
Kyle Simpson has a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language. Altough the content isn't written for ECMAScript 6, it is present.

## ECMAScript 7 (experimental features)
As we write future proof code, we are also looking at the new proposed functionality. These are categorised in 5 stages:
* Stage 0: Strawman
* Stage 1: Proposal
* Stage 2: Draft
* Stage 3: Candidate
* Stage 4: Finished

### General reads and documentations
Babel has a nice write up about [how to use experimental ES7 features](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/).
[JSfeatures.in](http://jsfeatures.in/#ES7) has a nice collection of minimalistic examples.
